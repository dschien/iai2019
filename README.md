# Individual project

Create an application around a chosen SemEval Task

In this project you take a SemEval task and wrap an application around it. As SemEval tasks focus on NLP concepts and methods, the user interfaces are minimal, e.g. command line interfaces and file based interaction. Your task is to construct a web application around these, applying good software engineering practices.

You will be given a set of online tutorials that cover activities, including software engineering life cycle activities, as well as web app development. The tutorials are spring boards - they will not include all the necessary steps required for your chosen application. The expectation is that you go through the tutorials and identify what additional steps you need to make them suit your project.  At the end youâ€™ll write a report that describes the system you built following and expanding from the tutorials you have been given.
